        <p>Hey! I am Daniel Kalu and I am from Nigeria. I am currently a student
            of BYU Idaho and I am studying Computer Programming and Web Development.
            I have a strong passion for my course and have set our goals to achieve maximum success.
            Apart from my studies in BYU, I love learning new languages in the Duolingo app. I have an
            intermediate langugae skill in Spanish and French and I hope to become fluent in them.
            I am a lover of languages and I hope to make the best out of my chosen career field.
            You can reach out to me whenever, as I would be glad to make new connections. Warm regards!
